// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
// which is calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) 
//(mass in kg and height in meter).


// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable' mark Higher BMI'containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.


// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

let markBMI=markWeight / (markHeight * markHeight);
let johnBMI=johnWeight / (johnHeight * johnHeight);


console.log(markBMI,johnBMI);

markHigherBMI=markBMI>johnBMI;

console.log("Is Mark's BMI is higher than John's? ",markHigherBMI);
