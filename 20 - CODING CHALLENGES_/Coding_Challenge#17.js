//and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).

// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects,and for each dog, calculate the recommended
// food portion and add it to the object as a new property.
// Do not create a new array, simply loop over the array.

//(The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg)

// Â§ Use many different tools to solve these challenges,
// you can use the summary lecture to choose between them ðŸ˜‰

// Â§ Being within a range 10% above and below the
