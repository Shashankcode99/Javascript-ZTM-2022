// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. 
// They compete against each other 3 times. 
// The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team,using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the 
// competition, and print it to the console. 
// Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)

// 3. Bonus1:Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. 
// With this rule,a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other
//  team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. 
// Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, 
// as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉


// 4. Bonus2:Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens 
// when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater 
// or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123 §
//  Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
